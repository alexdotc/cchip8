# cchip8
A CHIP-8 interpreter in C. SDL2 as a graphics frontend. All the basic functionality is there with a handful of games tested.

## Instructions
    make
    ./chip8.out /path/to/your/rom
    
## Possible TODOs

- Separate out ome of the boilerplate SDL code. Should have a platform layer
- Getopt or some options lib for more command line options
